example gz-files for chlorophyll, sea surface temperature and ocean fronts data were derived from the pathfinder AVHRR sea surface temperature (SST) dataset, version 5.2, provided by GHRSST and the US National Oceanographic Data Center (http://pathfinder.nodc.noaa.gov), and the SST and chlorohphll-a datasets from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS-Aqua), available on the NASA ocean color web server (http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/).

the netcdf-file holding herring larval dispersal were parts of calculations from:
Bauer, R. K., Stepputtis, D., Grawe, U., Zimmermann, C., and Hammer, C. 2013. Wind-induced variability in coastal larval retention areas: a case study on Western Baltic spring-spawning herring. Fisheries Oceanography, 22: 388-399.

bathymetric data of the Baltic Sea was provided by Ulf Graewe from the Leibniz Institute for Baltic Sea Research Warnemuende
